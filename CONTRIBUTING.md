3. Make sure everything is OK and your code lints.
4. Issue a pull request
5. Update the documentation if necessary.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/joanrodas/plubo/issues)
GitHub issues are great to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/joanrodas/plubo/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Specific steps to reproduce, preferably with sample code
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happens
- Notes. Anything you think could be helpful. Things you've tried, what you think could be the cause or even suggesting possible solutions


## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Tabs for indentation
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
